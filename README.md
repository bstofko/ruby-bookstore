# README

Description: This is a Bookstore App written in Ruby on Rails that allows users to view books, authors, and publishers (i.e. Book, Author, and Publisher models). Users can add, update, remove, and view books, authors, and publishers as well as a search bar to query books using keywords (functionality described below).

Further search and db migrations in development.

Search:
- Currently searches for books with titles that closely match the name column of the Book Model Table in the schema.
