# README

Description: This is a Bookstore App written in Ruby on Rails that allows users to view books, authors, and publishers (i.e. Book, Author, and Publisher models). Users can add, update, remove, and view books, authors, and publishers as well as a search bar to query books using keywords (functionality described below).

Search:
- Currently searches for books with titles that closely match the name column of the Book Model Table in the schema.

In progress:
- Allow the search query to search for author or publisher matching an exact string in the Author and Publisher tables. This will return a collection of books that match the author_id and publisher_id fields of the Book Table to find books that belong to an author or publisher.
